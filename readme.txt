		shortly after i completed the code, I went to scan my letter fonts to trace
		with this bonus. however I started getting Error in `./boilerplate.out' as
		provided with the screenshot in this folder. I was able to meet the 
		requirements of the second bonus, and move and adjsut the points accordingly.
		However after I scanned my writing, I'm not sure what happened, but the program
		aborts after several control points have been added. Not sure how this happened
		as nothing has been changed. But John was in the labs and witnessed the
		capability of adding, removing and dragging control points.
